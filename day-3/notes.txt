Spring Microservices and Spring Cloud:
--------------------------------------------------

Monolithic:
---------------

E-commerce application:
-----------------------------------

   a) Product Service      => Controller, Service, Dao, Model, UI 
   b) Customer Service   
   c) Cart Service
   d) Order Service
   e) Payment Service

Presentation Layer (UI)
Business Layer       
Data Layer 

  -- Finally when we package our application , we have heavy .war file.
  
What are the common problems with monolithic architecture:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    1) Scalalbility: If there is high traffic for the product service, so we need to scale it. We will take .war file and deploy on other servers. Problem => we scaled entire                             application not product service. 

    2) Code change: If there is requirement to change a code, we need to recompile, test and rebuild / repackage our application, so frequent release cycle is not possible.
                              We have redeploy our application on each and every machine.

    3) Stick to one technology.
 
Microservices:
-------------------
 
 -- different way / approach of building an application.
 -- We break monolithic application into the smaller services.
   
E-commerce application:
-----------------------------------

   a) Product Service      => Controller, Service, Dao, Model, UI 
   b) Customer Service   
   c) Cart Service
   d) Order Service
   e) Payment Service

 -- All these services are separate projects / applications. 
 -- Independent services.
 -- These services are developed and deployed independently. 
 -- There will be inter-communication between these microservices.
 -- Each microservice can have its own database.
 -- Modularity.
 -- Polygot 
 -- Scalability (We can scale product services if needed without scaling other microservices)
 -- Makes release early, fast development (Frequent release cycle. Frequent code change).

    ]
} 


Spring Cloud:
-----------------
  1) Eureka Server
  2) Config Server
  3) API Gateway (Zuul)
  4) Hystrix

Eureka Server:
--------------------

Why Hard coded URLs are bad?
---------------------------------------
-- Change in URL requires code updates.
-- If we deploy our application on any cloud provider like AWS, GCP etc..., we will get dynamic URLs.
-- Load Balancing
-- Based on environments, URLs will be different. (dev, test/QA, prod)

Service Discovery Pattern:
----------------------------------
   a) Client-side service discovery
   b) Server-side service discovery

Steps:
-----------
a) We need to start the Eureka Server
b) Have microservices register themeselves to Eureka Server using Eureka Client
c) Have microservices locate (consume) other microservices using Eureka Client.

By default port number of Eureka Server is 8761

-- Technology to implement service discovery pattern that Spring cloud uses is "Eureka"

Netflix Open Source:

  a) Eureka is one of the projects that made open source thanks to netflix
  b) Netflix has bunch of libraries and later they madet them open source

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-- In spring cloud, client side service discovery is used.


        <dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
        </dependency>

       <dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
        </dependency>

-- Create a new Spring Boot project as "eureka-server".
-- Add eureka server dependency.

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
        </dependency>

-- Add @EnableEurekaServer annotation to main class.
-- Add below properties in application.properties file.

server.port=8761
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-- Add eureka client dependency in all services (movie-info-service, movie-catalog-service, user-rating-service)

       <dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
        </dependency>

-- Add @EnableEurekaClient in main class of all services (movie-info-service, movie-catalog-service, user-rating-service).

-- Add spring.application.name property in application.properties file of all services.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-- Start Eureka server first
-- Then start all services (movie-info-service, movie-catalog-service, user-rating-service) one by one.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Q. Can we change Eureka port?
---------------------------------------
-- Yes

* In application.properties of Eureka server:

server.port=9090

* In all client services, we have to add one property in application.properties file

eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:9090


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Feign client:
-----------------

   -- Wrapper over RestTemplate
   -- Declarative style
   -- Internal load balancing
   -- Support Circuit Breaker


-- Add dependencies:

                              <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
		</dependency>
                              <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
		</dependency>

-- Add feign clients

package com.training.moviecatalogservice.feignclient;

@FeignClient(name="movie-info-service")
@RibbonClient(name="movie-info-service")
public interface MovieInfoServiceProxy {

	@GetMapping("/api/v1/movies/{movieId}")
	public ResponseEntity<Movie> getMovieDetails(@PathVariable int movieId); 
}

---------------------------

package com.training.moviecatalogservice.feignclient;

@FeignClient(name="user-rating-service")
@RibbonClient(name="user-rating-service")
public interface UserRatingServiceProxy {
	
	@GetMapping("api/v1/ratings/{userId}")
	public ResponseEntity<UserRating> getMovieRatings(@PathVariable String userId);	
		
}

-----------------------------

-- Add annotation @EnableFeignClients in main class.

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
@EnableFeignClients("com.training.moviecatalogservice.feignclient")
public class MovieCatalogServiceApplication {
   .....
}

-- Feign client uses Ribbon as load balancer.
   
-----------------------------

Config Server:
------------------

Centralized Configuration: [Config Server]

Why Centralized Configuration?
----------------------------------------

When we talk about microservices architecture, we visualize a large number of small microservices talking to each other.
The interesting part is that each of these microservices can have its own configuration.

Such configuration includes details such as:

Application configuration
Database configuration
Communication Channel Configuration - queues and other infrastructure
URLs of other microservices to talk to
In addition, each microservice would have a separate configuration for different environments, such as development, qa and production.

* Spring Boot provides feature "Profiling".

dev
prod
test

* What else if configuration changes.?
-- If configuration changes, We need to update application.properties file. We need to repacked, redeploy our application. [All running instances of that application we need to redeploy with the new changes].

Configuration for all microservices (for all environments) is stored at one place - a centralized configuration store.
When a microservice needs its configuration, it provides an id at launch - a combination of microservice name and the environment.

The centralize config server looks up the configuration and provides the configuration to the microservice.
s

Setup Config Server:

1) Create a new Spring boot starter project
2) Add the dependencies:   config-server and eureka-discovery-client

                              <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server</artifactId>
		</dependency>
                             <dependency>
                               	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	                              <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
                             </dependency>

3) Add annotation @EnableConfigServer and @EnableEurekaClient
4) Update application.properties file of config server. Specify the path where configurations are kept

    server.port=8888

    spring.profiles.active=native 
   (Because you’re using the filesystem for storing application configuration information, you need to tell Spring Cloud configuration server to run with the     “native” profile)

    spring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations=file:///C:\\AmitF\\Training_Docs\\Spring_Training_Feb\\config\\{application}
  
  The important parameter in the configuration entry is the searchLocations attribute. This attribute provides a comma separated list of the directories for     each application that’s going to have properties managed by the configuration server.
 

5) Add config-client dependency in all services.

                              <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
		</dependency>

6) Remove application.properties file from all services and add bootstrap.properties 
  
     We need to add below tag in pom.xml under <build> tag. [ Optional Step ]

    		<resources>
			<resource>
				<filtering>true</filtering>
				<directory>src/main/resources</directory>
				<includes>
					<include>*.properties</include>
					<include>common-config/</include>
				</includes>
			</resource>
		</resources>   

7) Update bootstrap.properties file and specify the location of config server.

    spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=true
    spring.cloud.config.discovery.serviceId=config-server
    spring.cloud.config.uri=http://config-server


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) Custom proeprties and consume in application
2) Feign client response to exception 
3) Protecting application.properties access.

* SERVING CONFIGURATION FROM GIT SUBPATHS

-- If you want to store configuration files in subpath instead of root path of git repo, we can configure it with below   
   property. For eg. You have created "config" folder in root path of git repo.   
   
   spring.cloud.config.server.git.search-paths = config 

-- you can have Config Server serve from multiple paths by listing them, separated by commas

   spring.cloud.config.server.git.search-paths = config, moreConfig 

-- spring.cloud.config.server.git.search-paths = config, more*

   Config Server will serve configuration from /config as well as any subdirectory whose name begins with “more.”    
   
-- The spring.cloud.config.server.git.default-label property overrides the default label or branch.
   
   spring.cloud.config.server.git.default-label = new-feature     


-- Spring Cloud Bus

* Spring Cloud Bus:

-- Application when started reads configuration from config server, if we make any changes after microservices have run, then
   we have to restart the services.
-- Spring Cloud Bus helps us to push configuration changes to all microservices while they are running.
-- Microservices do not need to be restarted to receive these updated configuration changes and to use these updated 
   configurations.
-- To use Spring Cloud bus, we don't need to create a separate standalone microservice. We have to just add 2 dependencies, 
   spring cloud bus and actuators to config server and add spring cloud bus dependency to all microservices.   
-- Microservices act as subscribers/listeners to receive updates from Spring cloud config server.
-- Messaging technology is used to broadcast all the changes to all microservices. 
-- Protocol use in communication is AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol). Asynchronous messaging.
-- Message Broker need to be configured, RabbitMQ. It is an intermediary for messaging. It gives common platform to send and 
   receive messages and for messages a safe place to live until they are received.
-- We have to make configuration so that all microservices will be subscribed for configuration updates, Spring cloud bus can 
   broadcast configuration changes and all our microservices will be able to recieve those changes.

http://localhost:8888/actuator/bus-refresh
POST request
   
   
* Add Dependencies:

-- spring cloud bus amqp
-- actuators


* Broadcast the changes:

-- Once we update configuration in git repo, we need to tell spring cloud bus that its time to broadcast configuration changes
   all microservices that have subscribed to these udpates.
-- We can do this by sending http post request to an actuator endpoint called /bus-refresh.
-- This will make spring cloud server to load new configuration from git repo and it also makes spring cloud bus to broadcast 
   these configuration changes to all subscribed microservices.
-- /bus-refresh endpoint helps to clear the refresh scope cache and rebind configuration properties in our microservices.
-- Enable /bus-refresh endpoint.
-- management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=bus-refresh in application.properties of config server.


* Install and run RabbitMQ server

-- 

* For our application to communicate with spring cloud bus and spring cloud bus to communicate with all our microservices, 
  Both need to connect to RabbitMQ.

-- application.properties of config server.

    spring.rabbitmq.host = localhost
    spring.rabbitmq.port = 5672
    spring.rabbitmq.username = guest
    spring.rabbitmq.password = guest

-- Add to all microservices.
